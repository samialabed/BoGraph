# Synthetic functions

Synthetic functions that provide quick runtime measurements.
Every term should be broken decomposed and provided as a key in a dictionary to provide a structure. (Addition is an easy decomposition.)


## Single objective


Single objective synthetic function.

* Branin (2-dim)
  * Two parameters: x1, x2, that are in the continuous domain.

## MOBO

These functions show how we can adapt to multiple objectives (read vs write latency for example)
